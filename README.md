# Kentucky FGC Website

Following the OhioFGC framework, I'm creating a website to host information about all the things happening in the Kentucky FGC.

If you think something should be added to the site, get in contact with me here or on [twitter](https://twitter.com/sniffulls).

You can view the site [here](https://fgckentucky.com).
